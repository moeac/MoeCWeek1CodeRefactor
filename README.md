# MoeCWeek1CodeRefactor
Homework for Week 1 due 26/08/2021

HTML and CSS code were provided for a website.
We were tasked to apply HTML Semantic elements to the code, clean up unnecessary code, apply alt text to images and fix any broken links.

Started by applying HTML semantic elements to the HTML code. Changed all div tags to nav, aside, figure, main, footer and section.

Also added in comments to separate sections to easier navigate the code.

In the HTML code, I fixed a broken link, changed a few class names, changed the title and added alt text to images.

In the CSS code, I mainly deleted and combined unnecessary code. Also added in comments to separate the sections to easier navigate.

Website was tested to see all links working and maintaining exact same appearance as before.
